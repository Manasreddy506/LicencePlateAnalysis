Notebook
----------
1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset - License Plate Detection Data
3. Image Processing
	- resizing the image
	- converting the color bgr to rgb
	- converting the color bgr to gray
	- finding the contours based on edges
4. Drawing the contours
5. Detecting the License Plate
	- Finding the distance
	- find the index of coordinate 
	- assign index to previous and next coordinate
	- Finding the angle of rotation
	- Finding the contours 
6. Find the characters in the result images
	- segmenting the characters
	- make border to white
	- Estimation of characters
7. Building the Model using 
	- CNN and YoloV3 Weighs
	- CNN and YoloV4 Weighs
8. Predicting the License Plate Number
	- Predicting the output
	- showing the result
YoloV5
----------
9. Installing the packages required for yolov5 in Colab
10. Processing the Data based on yolov5 model
11. Building the model in colab
	- YOLOV5
12. Training the model
13. Building the model with YOLOv5
Flask Framework
----------------
14. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
15. User gives input as Image or Video
16. The given input preprocessed and with trained model is used for detecting the license plate 
	- CNN with YoloV4
	- YoloV5
17. The segmented each object and put bounding box 
18. Extracting the segment character using tesseract OCR
19. Final outcome is displayed
