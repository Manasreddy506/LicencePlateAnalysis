"# LicencePlateAnalysis" 
Hi sir/Madan, welcome to my repository. First of all thanks for giving me opportunity to introduce myself, this repository is all about myself I hope you guys enjoy reading it and get to know about me.
"License Plate Image Analysis Empowered by Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (GANs)"
ABSTACT:-
License Plate Image Analysis system is one of the smart transportation methods that provides a safe medium of transportation and monitoring planning used by many two-wheeler vehicles as well as four-wheeler vehicles to boost traffic controlling, routing, parking system, toll collection, and governance and insuring highway law. There are various techniques and algorithms has been developed so that we can identify and recognize Number plates. This paper shows a various deep learning approach for recognizing and detecting number plate. This system is divided into three parts, i.e.,number plate detection, segmentation, and character recognition. In our proposed system for number plate detection Yolo method is used, after that some filters are applied and then characters are segmented. Finally, the Convolutional Neural Network is used to recognize all the segmented characters.
